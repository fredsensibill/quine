/** The fundamental graph unit for both data storage (eg [[com.thatdot.quine.graph.NodeActor#properties()]]) and

  * time (see [[atTime]]).
  *
  * @param qidAtTime the ID that comprises this node's notion of nominal identity -- analogous to pekko's ActorRef
  * @param graph a reference to the graph in which this node exists
  * @param costToSleep @see [[CostToSleep]]
  * @param wakefulState an atomic reference used like a variable to track the current lifecycle state of this node.
  *                     This is (and may be expected to be) threadsafe, so that [[GraphShardActor]]s can access it
  * @param actorRefLock a lock on this node's [[ActorRef]] used to hard-stop messages when sleeping the node (relayTell uses
  *                     tryReadLock during its tell, so if a write lock is held for a node's actor, no messages can be
  *                     sent to it)

    // historical nodes.
