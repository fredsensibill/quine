## Models

This package contains internal object models. They implement the effects described in the user facing API.

We are considering renaming or replacing this package due to the word "models" suggesting "data models" to some readers.
This could take the form of extracting each sub-package to separate top level SBT projects, or just picking a
replacement word.
